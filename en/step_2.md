## What you will need

### Hardware

+ A computer capable of running Unity. The computer will need to be running either Windows or Mac OS.

### Software

+ Unity! These Sushi Cards are for Unity 2017.1, so if you have a different version, the pictures and some of the instructions might be a little different.

+ If you don't have Unity already, you'll need to install it and get it setup on your computer. This might take a while, as it's a big download and install.

### Additional Resources

+ Download the starter project from [dojo.soy/IntermediateUnityStarter](http://dojo.soy/IntermediateUnityStarter){:target="_blank"}. This has all of the assets you need to create a game with these Sushi Cards! You won't need to make your own new Unity Project, because this creates a project for you.

+ You will need to unzip the file you downloaded and open the project in Unity. Feel free to rearrange the layout of the various tabs and screen areas to suit you!

Also, depending on what operating system you have, you might get a message like this:

+ You might want to find different assets on the Unity Asset Store (if you don't like the ones in the download). In Unity go to **Window > Asset Store** and click on "Filters" (on the right of the search bar). Now click "FREE ONLY".
