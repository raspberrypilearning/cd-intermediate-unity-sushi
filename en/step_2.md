## What you will need

### Hardware

+ A computer capable of running Unity. The computer will need to be running either Windows or Mac OS.

### Software

+ Unity! These Sushi Cards are for Unity 2017.1, so if you have a different version, the pictures and some of the instructions might be a little different.

+ If you don't have Unity already, you'll need to install it and get it setup on your computer. This might take a while, as it's a big download and install.

+ Run the installer that downloads and follow the on-screen instructions, accepting all the default options.

+ Wait for the the download and installation steps to complete.

+ Once installed, you will need to create an account or sign in to use Unity. This is so that you can access the free version which is for personal use.

### Additional Resources

+ Download the starter project from [dojo.soy/IntermediateUnityStarter](http://dojo.soy/IntermediateUnityStarter). This has all of the assets you need to create a game with these Sushi Cards! You won't need to make your own new Unity Project, because this creates a project for you. You will need to unzip the file you downloaded and open the project in Unity.

---

+ You might want to find different assets on the Unity Asset Store (if you don't like the ones in the download). In Unity go to **Window > Asset Store** and click on "Filters" (on the right of the search bar). Now click "FREE ONLY".
