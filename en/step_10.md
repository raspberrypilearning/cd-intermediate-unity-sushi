## Go Further

Now that you're done with the game you can change it up a little. Here are some ideas

+ You can try to fix the problem at the end of the **Detecting Collisions** Card. **Hint:** Try using a boolean and checking its value to see if the player should be moving.

+ Implement keyboard controls for the spaceship! **Hint:** You used the keys for controls in the first tutorial, take a look at that. 

+ Try getting another asset from the resources listed on the front page. Try and create them like you did with the asteroids. **Hint:** You need to make your asset into a prefab first! Go back to the first tutorial if you don't remember how to make a prefab.

+ Learn more about the programming language you have been using with Unity: C#. Here is a link to Microsoft's Beginner tutorial [dojo.soy/CSharpTutorial](http://dojo.soy/CSharpTutorial){:target="_blank"}.
