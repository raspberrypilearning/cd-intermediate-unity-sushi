## Move the player
Now that you've got a ship on screen, you need to give the player a way to move it!

--- task ---
Create a folder in your Assets folder and name it `Scripts`. Now create a new C# script in your new folder. This program will have a lot of scripts, so it's important to be able to identify them easily. Call this one `PlayerController`. 
--- /task ---

--- task ---
Attach your new script to your `Player` object by selecting the `Player` and dragging the script into the inspector pannel.
--- /task ---

--- task ---
Open the script and add this code inside the `Update` function to let your player's mouse control their spaceship.

```csharp
Vector3 mousePos = Input.mousePosition;  
mousePos.z = 15f;
transform.position = Camera.main.ScreenToWorldPoint(mousePos);
```
--- /task ---

title: What does the code do?
---

A **Vector3**s is a **structure**. A structure stores multiple variables in one unit.

Unity uses Vector3 to keep track of an object's position in the world â€” its (X, Y, Z) coordinates. So, when you set the **Vector3** equal to the `Input.mouseposition`, the `x` and `y` values of the Vector3 are changed each frame (because it is in the `Update` function).

`Input.mousePosition` doesn't change the `z` value of the Vector3. With the second line of code, you're setting the `z` value by using `.` (called the 'dot operator').

The third line of code moves the `Player` object to the position of the mouse:
* `transform.position` changes the location of your `Player` object
* `Camera.main.ScreenToWorldPoint(mousePos)` sets the position of your `Player` object in the game world

Run the game and test out the controls you've just added
--- /task ---

Did you notice that the `Player` object doesn't stay on the screen? 

In the **Scene** tab, you can change the angle you're viewing from, and zoom out so that you can see objects that go "off the screen". This can be quite usefuL, for example when an object is not appearing and you want to work out why, or where it went.

--- task ---
Keep the player's ship on screen by by adding this section of code below the code you've already included in the `Update` function
    
```csharp
Vector3 spritePos = Camera.main.WorldToViewportPoint(transform.position);
spritePos.x = Mathf.Clamp(spritePos.x, 0.05f, 0.95f);
spritePos.y = Mathf.Clamp(spritePos.y, 0.1f, 0.9f);
transform.position = Camera.main.ViewportToWorldPoint(spritePos);
```
--- /task ---

The first line of code here gets the position of our `Player` object.

You can then use the `Mathf` function `Clamp` to keep the `Player` object within the camera's viewpoint. `Clamp` restricts the position of the `Player` object by preventing the values of its X and Y coordinates from exceeding the given values.

--- /collapse ---

Now the `Player` object follows your mouse cursor, but it would be nice to remove the cursor. Let's do that.

--- task ---
Adding this line of code into the `Start` function to get rid of the cursor:

```csharp
Cursor.visible = false;
```
--- /task ---

--- task ---
Try running the game again and moving the `Player` object with your mouse! Check that it says on screen!
--- /task ---
