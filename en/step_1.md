Make a 3D space game using the Unity platform.

### What you will make

In these Sushi Cards you will learn how to make a game that is similar to the classic Asteroids game! The player will control a space drone that is flying through asteroids. You will learn how to use mouse input, move other objects that aren't your player, and how to send the game to your friends.
