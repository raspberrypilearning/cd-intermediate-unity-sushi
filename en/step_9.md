## Sharing Your Game

Only people have who have Unity can play your game right now. You can **build** (package your game up) your project so that you can send it to your friends to try out. 

When you build your game, you are creating an **executable file** for the specific system that you choose. That could be PC, Mac, or Linux. Or it could be on a mobile platform! To build a game go (**File > Build Settings**)

+ In the **Platform** menu make sure PC, Mac, Linux Standalone is selected. Make sure the **Target Platform** is the operating system you're using.

+ Click **Player Settings** in the bottom right. This will bring up the Player Settings in the **Inspector**. Put your nickname (or have fun and make up your own company name) in for the **CompanyName** and make a game name for the **Product Name**. You can also set the **Default Icon** to the "GameIcon". 

+ Click on **Resolution and Presentation** and uncheck **Default is FullScreen**.

+ Back in the **Build Settings** menu click **Build and Run**. Save your game as anything you want (we used `UnityIntermediateSushi`).

+ A window should pop-up with some settings. Make sure the **resolution** is the same as the resolution you used in your standalone **Game View** in Unity. Also make sure **windowed** is checked!

+ Click **Play!**

+ All you need is to give your friends the `.exe` file and the `_Data` folder and they can play your new game! (Our file and folder were called `UnityIntermediateSushi.exe` and `UnityIntermediateSushi_Data`)
